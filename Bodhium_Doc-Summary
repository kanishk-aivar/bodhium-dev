## üîÑ Complete System Flow Summary
Based on your description, here's the complete process flow:

### Phase 1: URL Processing (5-10 minutes)
User Input: URL submitted through frontend or API
Web Scraping: AWS Batch job crawls website and extracts products
AI Processing: Google Gemini analyzes and structures product data
Storage: Results saved to S3 and RDS

### Phase 2: Query Generation (2-3 minutes)
Product Analysis: Query Generator analyzes scraped products
AI Generation: Gemini creates 50 queries per product (25 product + 25 market)
Database Storage: Queries stored in RDS with product associations
S3 Backup: Query data backed up to S3

### Phase 3: LLM Processing (2-3 minutes)
Orchestration: LLM Orchestrator distributes queries to 4 providers
Parallel Processing: All providers process queries simultaneously
Result Aggregation: Results combined and normalized
Storage: Final results saved to S3 and RDS

### Phase 4: Result Display (Real-time)
Frontend Updates: Real-time streaming of results to UI
User Interaction: Users can view, filter, and export results
Logging: All events logged to DynamoDB for monitoring


## üèóÔ∏è Key System Components
Web Scraper: AWS Batch with Gemini AI for product extraction
Query Generator: Lambda function creating intelligent queries
LLM Orchestrator: Lambda managing 4 LLM providers in parallel
LLM Providers: AI Mode, AI Overview, ChatGPT, Perplexity
Frontend UI: React application with real-time streaming
Data Storage: S3, RDS, and DynamoDB for comprehensive data management


## üîê Security & Monitoring
API and RDS credentials: Managed through AWS Secrets Manager
DynamoDB logging: Comprehensive logging throughout the system
Real-time monitoring: CloudWatch metrics and alarms
Error handling: Robust retry logic and fallback mechanisms
The documentation provides everything needed to understand, deploy, and maintain your Bodhium system, including detailed flow diagrams that visualize the complete process from URL input to final results display.
